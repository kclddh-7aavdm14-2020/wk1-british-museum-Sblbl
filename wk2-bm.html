					Google Art & Culture is a non-profit project made in collaboration with artists and institutions. 
				</p>
				<h3>Content</h3>
				<p>
					The Google Art & Culture is an archive of contents related to the cultural heritage of countries all over the world. It hosts a digital version of visual material such as paintings, sculptures and photographs, but also evidences of the most important cultural locations like archaeological sites.

					<h3>Homepage</h3>
					<p>The homepage gives a glance of the website's offer: we see that it's possible to explore many museums' collections in high quality, visit via street view their halls and play with experimental functionalities like VR and the search by color.</p>
				</div>
				<div class='subsection'>
					<h3>Metadata</h3>
					<p>
						Many metadata are used to classify the content. The most simple are:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>title</li>
						<li>author</li>
						<li>date</li>
						<li>provenance</li>
						<li>original title</li>
						<li>dimensions</li>
						<li>type</li>
						<li>material</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Probably the contents are also classified via some more complicated process involving AI. For example, a color-based search is available to look for artworks with similar tints.
					</p>

				<div class='subsection'>
					<h3>Content explaination</h3>
					<p>A more accurate comment is made available by the biggest museums. However, not all the masterpieces are accompained by an explainatory text.</p>
				</div>
				<div class='subsection'>
					<h3>It's Google</h3>
					<p>Since Google owns the project, all the resources are built via some Google API. The website also follows the material design principles ideated for and by the company.</p>

					<h3>It's Google</h3>
					<p>Since Google owns the project, all the resources are built via some Google API. The website also follows the material design principles ideated for and by the company.
					The diffusion of Google allows not only to the project to be reachable, but also to be considered authoritative, fact that implies that a lot of museums have decided to share their collections through it. 
					</p>

					<h3>Comment</h3>
					<p>
						One of the biggest merits of this platform is that it provides high quality images. This means that a student can use this project to study history of art and a normal user can enjoy the contents for certain aspects better than in a museum, where the crowd or the light conditions can influence the experience.
						The classification, however, could be more detailed, and the general tone of the project is quite pop. This last point is not necessarily a defect, because it aims to approach people to the world of art; however, a specialist needing some more detailed information could not use this Google Arts & Culture.
