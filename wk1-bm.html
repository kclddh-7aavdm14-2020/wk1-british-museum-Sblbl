						</p>
					</div>
					<div class='subsubsection'>
						<h3>Blog</h3>
						<p>
							Since the Museum offers a lot of different experiences that change during time, a blog is a useful instrument to collect some articles relative to the temporary exibitions ad events and to organize an editorial. This allows to keep tidy and restrained the content of the website and at the same time to be a dynamic institution.

					<h2>Conditions of possibility</h2>
					<p>
						It's intuitable that a so huge collection of information and materials of different typology has to be managed by a wide team. The quality of the photographies and of the copywrite indicates that professional figures have been involved in the construction of the archive.
						It's possible however that the stable team is quite reducted and only manages the editorial content, while many professionals were involved to create the archive's database system and all the digital material, such as the photographs and the 3D models.
